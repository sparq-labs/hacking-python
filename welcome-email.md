# Intro to Intro to Python Workshop Thing

Hello! You should be recieving this email if you have signed up for the Python
workshop by Sparq Labs tomorrow evening. I'm Phil, and for some reason I was
offered the chance to run this worshop. I'm excited!

*[see this message on GitHub](https://github.com/sparq-labs/hacking-python/blob/master/welcome-email.md)*


## ACTION ITEM: GET GITHUB

**Make an account on [GitHub](https://github.com/).**

Skip all of this fluffy intro email if you want, except that. Make an account.
That's all the prep I ask, and if everyone already has an account we can save
a lot of time tomorrow.


## Optional Actions:

### Send me your github username

My email address is [uniphil@gmail.com](mailto:uniphil@gmail.com). I'll add
you to the workshop project so you can get a sneak peek. I'm
[uniphil](https://github.com/uniphil) on github.

### Try some stuff

These are some tools we'll use tomorrow. If you give them a shot beforehand,
well... I don't know learning is fun. Some places to start:

**git**: [try git](http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)

**Python**: [codecademy]
(http://www.codecademy.com/courses/introduction-to-python-6WeG3/0/1)

**Bash (linux shell)**: I couldn't find a good online interactive tutorial.
If you have linux installed on a computer, try playing with these commands:
https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UsingTheTerminal
Otherwise don't worry about it. It's simple.


## The Workshop

**This section is very ignorable**

I know you were promised an intro to python programming workshop. It's going
to be slightly different from what you probably expect. I hope it's better.

The first thing is, the internet contains **really, truly, incredible resources
for teaching yourself to code. I can not top those**.

The second thing is, to give an intro to a programming language in lecture
format is

 1. Silly (as are typical lectures in general, but that's another topic)
 2. Dry and boring
 3. Way too short to do anything
 4. Probably not motivating

I think that the best way to learn to code, is to... code.

So with all that in mind: tomorrow could be more acurately be titled **Intro to
Python Hacking**. I am **not** going to be telling you how to write code in
python. We're just going to go ahead and actually write code in python. I mean,
hack code in python.

Also, some guy called Larry Wall claims that there are [three great virtues]
(http://threevirtues.com/) of a programmer:

 1. Laziness
 2. Impatience
 3. Hubris

Most of it will be done for you (trust me, it always is), and we'll minimize
the work we still have to do (laziness). Forget the lecture, we'll be jumping
right in (impatience) and building it. And hell yeah we can build a web app in
under two hours! (hubris).

blah blah blah I could go on but this is getting way to long. So yeah!
Tomorrow we'll be building a web app! Oh yeah and raspberry pi and stuff. Woo
hoo!


## Stuff for you

 * [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/) is awesome. It's a great place to
   get started programming.

 * [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/toc/index.html) is where I
   got started with python. It's a great intro and guide.

 * [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) is a really great collection of
   Q/A-style programming info. The python tag is *very* active, with lots of
   questions posted and people answering very quickly.


## TL;DR

Just make an account at github.com. See you tomorow!

It's nice because it's easy to read and write raw Markdown, and computers can
parse it and make it look nice. I put [this message on GitHub]
